Estimated using ARX on time domain data.        
Fit to estimation data: 96.4% (prediction focus)
FPE: 0.5187, MSE: 0.4999    

Warning: For transient data (step or impulse experiment), make sure that the change in input signal does not happen too
early relative to the order of the desired model. You can achieve this by prepending sufficient number of zeros
(equilibrium values) to the input and output signals. For example, a step input must be represented as [zeros(nx,1);
ones(N,1)] rather than ones(N,1), such that nx > model order.
